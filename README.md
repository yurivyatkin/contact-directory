## About

This is a simple web application which is intended to demonstrate the following ideas:

- software architectural thinking;

- decoupled frontend and backend;

- a DevOps mindset;

- some benefits of using the latest technology;

- applicability of JavaScript and Node to solving real-life problems.

## Functional requirements

1. The app should display a list of contacts retrieved from a backend service.

1. When a contact is clicked, a business card of this contact should be presented.
The business card should contain the following attributes:
    - full name;
    - position;
    - phone number;
    - email;
    - full address;
    - website (URL);
    - taglines (an array of strings).

1. The business card of the client could potentially be an image of their real business card (scanned during the data entry process), but if such is not available, a default business card should be presented (as a generated view).

1. The app should allow to make a simple search in the contact list.

1. The app should show in a separate view how many contacts starting from each alphabet letter are there.

1. The app should show each contact's location on a map.

## Non-functional requirements

1. The app should be nice and easy to use (give the user experience a priority).

1. The app should be a pleasure to develop (mind the developer experience too).

1. The app should be easy to deploy (think about continuous deployment).

1. The backend service should be scalable (in all possible directions, if possible).

1. The code should be "production-ready" (deploying it to production will not harm anyone).

1. The project should have a clear and meaningful structure and code organization.

1. All the manual tasks should be automated if possible (use build tools).

1. Standard tasks should be solved using design patterns, whenever this applies.
