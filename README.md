# Contact Directory

## About

This is a simple web application which is intended to demonstrate the following ideas:

- software architectural thinking;

- decoupled frontend and backend;

- a DevOps mindset;

- some benefits of using the latest technology;

- applicability of JavaScript and Node to solving real-life problems.

## Functional requirements

1. The app should display a list of contacts retrieved from a backend service.

1. When a contact is clicked, a business card of this contact should be presented.
The business card should contain the following attributes:
    - full name;
    - position;
    - phone number;
    - email;
    - full address;
    - website (URL);
    - taglines (an array of strings).

1. The business card of the client could potentially be an image of their real business card (scanned during the data entry process), but if such is not available, a default business card should be presented (as a generated view).

1. The app should allow to make a simple search in the contact list.

1. The app should show in a separate view how many contacts starting from each alphabet letter are there.

1. The app should show each contact's location on a map.

## Non-functional requirements

1. The app should be nice and easy to use (give the user experience a priority).

1. The app should be a pleasure to develop (mind the developer experience too).

1. The app should be easy to deploy (think about continuous deployment).

1. The backend service should be scalable (in all possible directions, if possible).

1. The code should be "production-ready" (deploying it to production will not harm anyone).

1. The project should have a clear and meaningful structure and code organization.

1. All the manual tasks should be automated if possible (use build tools).

1. Standard tasks should be solved using design patterns, whenever this applies.

## License

This work is in the public domain.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
